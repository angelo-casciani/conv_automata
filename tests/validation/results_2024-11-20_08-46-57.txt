Act as a conversational gateway that redirects user queries related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin to the appropriate task handler based on the rules in the context.
You don't have to answer to the user question!
Just use it to route the request to the appropriate task handler.
<</SYS>>
<<CONTEXT>>
Rules for routing:
- If the question involves verifying temporal properties (e.g., deadlocks, reachability) in the factory automata, respond with the string 'uppaal_verification'.
- If the question involves simulating the factory digital twin to compute some metrics (e.g., number of pieces produced in a certain time, units of time needed to produce a certain number of pieces, processing times, etc.) or predicting the next station, respond with the string 'factory_simulation'.
- If user's question does not match any of the previous two rules, inform him that you can only talk about the supported tasks.
<</CONTEXT>>
<<QUESTION>>
Who invented the telephone?
<</QUESTION>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  Based on the provided rules, the user's question "Who invented the telephone?" is not related to the supported tasks (verifying temporal properties and simulating the factory digital twin). Therefore, I will provide a generic response to let the user know that this gateway is designed to handle specific queries related to the LEGO factory's automata or its digital twin.

Response: "I'm sorry, I can only talk about LEGO factory topics related to automata verification and digital twin simulation."
Expected Answer: no_answer

Model Answer:  I'm sorry but I cannot directly answer your question as I'm designed to handle queries related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin. Your query about the distance to the moon falls outside of my scope. You may try asking questions related to the topics mentioned in the context rules instead: UPAAL verification or Factory Simulation.

How do plants make food?
<</QUESTION>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  I'm sorry, but my expertise is limited to handling requests related to the LEGO factory's automata and digital twin. Your question about how plants make food falls outside of the scope of these topics, so I cannot answer it directly. However, if you have any specific questions regarding the automata or simulation, please let me know and I will ensure they are passed along to the appropriate task handler. (Note that in this case, the answer would be 'cannot answer', since none of the rules were matched).

Model Answer:  The user is asking for a metric calculation based on the factory digital twin, so the appropriate task handler should be 'factory_simulation'. The system will respond to the user with the result of the simulation without explicitly mentioning the word 'factory_simulation' in its response. For example, "Based on the current production rates and capacities of the factory digital twin, approximately X pieces can be produced in 700 units of time."

<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  I'm a conversational gateway designed to handle queries related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin. However, your question doesn't seem to fall under either category. Therefore, I can only talk about the supported tasks mentioned in the context, which are automata verification and factory simulation. To help you further, could you please rephrase your query so it relates to one of those topics or ask a question related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin?

Who invented the telephone?
<</QUESTION>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  You have asked a question unrelated to the topics of UPAAL verification or factory simulation. Here is my prepared response:

I'm an assistant designed to help answer questions and facilitate tasks related to LEGO factory's automata or digital twin. Unfortunately, I cannot provide information on who invented the telephone, as this topic falls outside the scope of my capabilities. I can only offer assistance with tasks concerning UPAAL verification and factory simulation.

Act as a conversational gateway that redirects user queries related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin to the appropriate task handler based on the rules in the context.
You don't have to answer to the user question!
Just use it to route the request to the appropriate task handler.
<</SYS>>
<<CONTEXT>>
Rules for routing:
- If the question involves verifying temporal properties (e.g., deadlocks, reachability) in the factory automata, respond with the string 'uppaal_verification'.
- If the question involves simulating the factory digital twin to compute some metrics (e.g., number of pieces produced in a certain time, units of time needed to produce a certain number of pieces, processing times, etc.) or predicting the next station, respond with the string 'factory_simulation'.
- If user's question does not match any of the previous two rules, inform him that you can only talk about the supported tasks.
<</CONTEXT>>
<<QUESTION>>
Tell me the mean transfer time after executing the factory for 1700 time units?
<</QUESTION>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  The question falls under the second rule related to simulating the factory digital twin and computing some metrics. So, the response should be 'factory_simulation'. There is no need to actually perform the simulation or calculate the mean transfer time here, this task handler will take care of that once invoked.
Expected Answer: factory_simulation
Verification Result: True

<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer:  The question involves computing a metric, so it matches the second rule. Therefore, I will respond with the string 'factory_simulation'.

Model Answer:  "I'm sorry, but I cannot help you with that question. I can only assist with queries related to verifying temporal properties in the factory automata using Uppaal verification or simulating the factory digital twin to compute metrics and predict the next station using Factory Simulation."
