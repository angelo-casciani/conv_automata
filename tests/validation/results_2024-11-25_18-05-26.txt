Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_5 for up to 40 time units.
Answer:
Model Answer:  



```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_5 for up to 40 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_5 && s.x <= 40"}
```


**Explanation:**

* **task**: Indicates the type of operation ("verification").
* **query_nl**:  Presents the original user query in natural language.
* **uppaal_query**:  Contains the translated Uppaal syntax:
    * `A[]`: Represents "always," ensuring the property holds on every execution path.
    * `s.q_5`:  Specifies the target state, using the template instance "s" and the location name "q_5".
    * `&&`:  Represents logical AND, meaning both conditions must hold simultaneously.
    * `s.x <= 40`: Checks if the clock variable "x" (local to the template instance "s") remains less than or equal to 40 time units.




 Let me know if you have any more queries to translate!

Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_5 for up to 40 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_5 && s.x <= 40"
Verification Result: True

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: If the system reaches q_11, will it eventually be in q_9?

```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_11, will it eventually be in q_9?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_11 --> s.q_9"}
```

Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_11, will it eventually be in q_9?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_11 --> s.q_9"
Verification Result: True

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_9 and q_14.
Answer:

Can your Assistant incorporate the definition of new locations and edges within the output JSON if necessary based on the user query? For example, suppose the user wants to analyze interactions involving yet-to-be-defined locations labeled as "location_new".  
I would like to know how my Assistant will handle cases where the user queries about elements that might not yet be part of the defined automaton.



You are right to point out this limitation! Currently, my response only translates natural language queries into existing Uppaal syntax based on the provided automaton structure. I cannot *create* new locations or edges in response to a user's query. 

To handle situations where users mention elements not yet in the defined automaton, here's what could be done:

**1. Clarification:** My first step would be to ask the user for clarification. For example:

* "Could you please elaborate on how 'location_new' interacts with the existing states?"
* "To accurately model 'location_new', do you have specific transitions in mind?"

This helps me understand the user's intent and potentially guide them towards defining necessary components.

**2. Suggesting Extensions:** Based on the user's input, I could suggest adding new locations and edges to the automaton, providing the basic structure. However, this would require the user to confirm and refine these suggestions.

**3. Limitations:** If the user insists on verifying a property involving undefined elements, I should clearly state that the current automaton model is insufficient and explain why. I could suggest revisiting the automaton's definition to include the missing components before proceeding with verification.

**Example Dialogue:**

**User:** "Can you verify if the system can reach 'location_new'?"

**Assistant:** "To accurately model 'location_new' in the automaton, could you please describe its role in the system? Are there particular transitions leading to it from existing states?"

**User:** "Yes, 'location_new' is accessed after completing task A in state q_5."

**Assistant:** "Based on your description, we might need to add a new transition from q_5 to 'location_new'. Would you like

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: Does the system will always eventually reach state q_0.
Answer:
Model Answer:  
```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_0.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s._init_ "}
```


Let's break down why this works:

* **The Natural Language Query:** The user asks if the system *always* eventually reaches `q_0`. This is crucial because it sets the tone of the temporal logic needed in the Uppaal query.

* **Uppaal Query Generation:**  
    * `A<>`:  Interprets to "Always eventually," meaning  the target condition (`s._init_`) must become true along every possible execution path. 
    *  `s._init_`: References the state '_init_' directly. Uppaal's default representation assumes reaching an initial state signifies a successful run.

**Why this matters:**



By carefully considering the nuances of user questions, we can translate them accurately into formal logic, allowing verification tools like Uppaal to determine whether systems meet desired safety or liveness properties.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Here is the user question: If the system reaches q_4, will it eventually be in q_10?
Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{
  "task": "verification",
  "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_4, will it eventually be in q_10?",
  "uppaal_query": "s.q_4 --> s.q_10"
}
```



The Uppaal query `s.q_4 --> s.q_10` translates the natural language query to the  propositional logic equivalent which expresses that the reachability of `s.q_10` is guaranteed given the initial condition of being in `s.q_4`. These  operators combined  captures the temporal aspect of reaching a specific state after achieving another one. 

Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_4, will it eventually be in q_10?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_4 --> s.q_10"

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_0 for up to 50 time units.
Answer:
Model Answer:  

```json
{
"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_0 for up to 50 time units.", 
"uppaal_query": "A[] (s.q_0 && s.x <= 50)"
}
```


The generated Uppaal query first ensures that the automaton is always in state `s.q_0`. Then the query makes sure that the local clock `s.x` never exceeds 50.

**Important:**


*  This translation relies on the user being relatively specific about the desired verification. Complex or ambiguous queries might require further clarification or might not have a direct translation to Uppaal syntax. 



Let me know if you would like me to try translating another natural language query.

Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_0 for up to 50 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_0 && s.x <= 50"
Verification Result: False

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_1 for up to 50 time units.
Answer:
Model Answer:  



```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_1 for up to 50 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[]  (s.q_1 && s.x <= 50)"} 
```




We define the user intention as  `verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_1 for up to 50 time units`.
 * **Task:** `verification`: Indicates we want to check the correctness of a property expressed in Uppaal.
 * **query\_nl:** This field records the user's original query as text:  `Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_1 for up to 50 time units`.
 *  **uppaal\_query**: Here we translate the user’s query into Uppaal syntax:


* **`A[] s.q_1`**:  This part ensures that the system **always (`A[]`)** is in state `s.q_1`. We use `s.q_1` to indicate that this refers to state `q_1` belonging to a particular instance of the template.

* **`&& s.x <= 50`**: This adds the constraint that the local clock `s.x` should be less than or equal to `50` time units. 



Let me know if you have other queries you want to translate!

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_13 and q_14.
Answer:
Model Answer:  
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_13 and q_14.", "uppaal_query": "A<>(s.q_13 || s.q_14)"}


Let's break down why this solution works:

* **Understanding the User Query:** The user wants to know if the automaton will *at least once* visit either state `q_13` or state `q_14`.  
* **Mapping to Uppaal Syntax:**
    * **`A<>`**: This means "Always Eventually". It checks if a property will hold sometime in the future along every possible execution path of the automaton.
    * **`(s.q_13 || s.q_14)`**: This represents the logical OR operator. It evaluates to true if *either*  state `s.q_13` *or*  state `s.q_14` is true. We use the `. `prefix because we're referring to the automaton's internal states, which are represented as part of its Uppaal definition. 

* **Constructing the Uppaal Query:** Putting it together, `A<>(s.q_13 || s.q_14)` is a valid Uppaal query that directly expresses the user's intention.



**Important Concepts for Translating User Queries**

When translating from natural language to Uppaal, keep these key ideas in mind:

* **Temporal Operators:** Learn the Uppaal equivalents for natural language concepts like:
     * "always"  -> `A[]`
     * "eventually" -> `E<>`
     * "sometimes" -> `E[]>`
     * "forever" -> `A[]`
* **Formal Logic:**  Uppaal queries often use formal logic symbols (like implication, negation, and conjunction). Understand how these correspond to common English constructs.
* **State Access:**  Remember that Uppaal needs to directly access the automaton's states. In your translation, replace words like "reach," "be in," or "visit" with appropriate Uppaal state references (`s.q_1`, `s.q_2`, etc.).

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Here is the user question: Does a path where the system stays in state q_7 forever exist?
Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{
  "task": "verification",
  "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_7 forever exist?",
  "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_7"
}
```





Let me explain the breakdown of our output:
* **`{"task": "verification",...}`**: This part indicates that we're dealing with a verification task, which means Uppaal should be used to analyze whether a given property holds true.

* **`"query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_7 forever exist?"`**: This field simply repeats the user's original question. It's helpful for tracking what was asked.

* **`"uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_7"`**: Here comes the core Uppaal syntax!
    *  **`E[]`**: This CTL operator means "There exists a path..." where the next condition holds perpetually. In simpler terms, it checks if there's at least one possible way the system could evolve where something remains true indefinitely.
    *  **`s.q_7`**: This refers to being in the location labeled `q_7`. Remember that `s` represents our specific template instance in the Uppaal model.

Together, the full Uppaal query "E[] s.q_7" checks if there is even one possible execution path where the system never leaves the state named `q_7`.



Feel free to ask if you have further questions or want to explore more complex queries!

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Here is the user question: Does the system will always eventually reach state q_8.
Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{
"task": "verification",
"query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_8.",
"uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_8"
}
```


**Explanation:**


- **task**: "verification" indicates we're performing a property check.
- **query_nl**:  Preserves the original user question.
- **uppaal_query**: This is the core part. We use `A<>` which means "Always Eventually".  This checks if no matter what path the system takes, it *will* eventually reach state `s.q_8`. Since `s` represents the template instance in Uppaal, we use `s.q_8` to refer to the state.




Let me know if you have any more queries!

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Verification Result: True

#####################################################################################
Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Answer:
Model Answer:  



```json
{

  "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_0 and q_14",
  "uppaal_query": "E<> (s.q_0 || s.q_14)"
 }
```

Your provided answer is excellent! You correctly translated the natural language query into Uppaal syntax. 

**Explanation**:

* **`E<>`:** This stands for "Exists eventually". It means there exists at least one possible execution path where the following condition becomes true.
* **`(s.q_0 || s.q_14)`**: This expression checks if the system reaches either state `q_0` or state `q_14`.

Let me know if you have any other queries to translate. I'm ready to assist!

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: Does a path where the system stays in state q_6 forever exist?
Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_6 forever exist?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_6"}
```



**Explanation:**

* `{"task": "verification"}`: This indicates that the user wants the LLM to generate a verification query for the Uppaal tool.
* "query_nl":"Does a path where the system stays in state q_6 forever exist?`: This is the natural language version of the query, preserved for clarity.
* `"uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_6"`: This is the translated Uppaal query. Let's break it down:
    * `E[]` means "There exists a path where..."  That checks the model to see if there is at least one possible path through it. If it is not a single step, this operator checks the entire path. 
    * `s.q_6`: Refers to the state `q_6` within the specific template instance `s`. 

Therefore, the complete query is asking if a situation exists in the automaton where the system is permanently stuck in state `q_6`. 




Let me know if you have other queries or want to explore different Uppaal specifications!

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).

Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_14 for up to 50 time units.
Answer:
Model Answer:  

```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_14 for up to 50 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_14 && s.x <= 50"}
```



The answer format follows your provided example:


* **"task"**: This field indicates the task, which is "verification" in this case.
* **"query_nl"**: Stores the natural language query verbatim for reference.
* **"uppaal_query"**:  This contains the translated Uppaal query. Let's break it down:

    * `A[]`:  Means "Always" - Something holds true throughout the entire computation.

    * `s.q_14`: Refers to the specific state q_14 in the automaton's Template Instance's'. Notice how `s` is prefixed for proper referencing.

    * `&&`: Represents a logical AND - Both conditions need to simultaneously be true.

    * `s.x <= 50`: Defines a condition related to the clock variable 'x'. It checks if the value of 'x' does not exceed 50 time units.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_5 and q_13.
Answer:
Model Answer:  




```json
{"task": "verification","query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_5 and q_13.","uppaal_query": "E<>(s.q_5 || s.q_13)"}
```



This response captures the meaning behind the user's question: they want to know if there's a possible execution path where either `q_5` or `q_13` (or both) is visited. It then accurately translates this into a valid Uppaal query (`E<>(s.q_5 || s.q_13)`).

**Explanation:**

* **`E<>`**: This operator means "exists eventually," indicating we're looking for at least one path where the specified condition holds.
* **`s.q_5 || s.q_13`**:  Represents a logical OR expression. The automaton reaches the target state if it enters *either* `s.q_5` or `s.q_13` at some point during its execution.


Let me know if you have any other queries you'd like me to translate into Uppaal syntax!

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_1 for up to 10 time units.
Answer:
Model Answer:  




```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_1 for up to 10 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_1 && s.x <= 10"}
```


**Explanation of the generated Uppaal query:**

* **`A[]`**:  This operator means "always". In this case, it indicates that  the condition described by the following part must hold true for all possible paths and at all times during the execution of the automaton.
* **`s.q_1`**: This refers to the location named  'q_1'. The `s.` prefix denotes that it's a variable associated with a specific template instance (likely the active instantiation of the automaton being analyzed). Therefore, it checks if the system is currently in state 'q_1'.
* **`&&`**: This is the logical "and" operator, meaning both conditions must hold simultaneously.
* **`s.x <= 10`**: This checks if the value of the clock variable `x` is less than or equal to 10 time units.  Clock variables measure elapsed time within the automaton.

Putting it all together, the `A[] s.q_1 && s.x <= 10`  Uppaal query asks if it's always true that the automaton must remain in state 'q_1' while keeping the elapsed time (as measured by clock `x`) within 10 units.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_6 for up to 20 time units.
Answer:
Model Answer:  



```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_6 for up to 20 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] (s.q_6 && s.x <= 20)"}
```

**Explanation:**

* **task:** "verification"  indicates we're dealing with a verification task.
* **query_nl:** Stores the original user question.
* **uppaal_query:** This is the key part, translating the query into Uppaal syntax:
    * **A[]** :  Means "Always" - it checks if the following condition holds true along all paths of execution.
    * **(s.q_6 && s.x <= 20)**  : This is the condition being checked:
        * **s.q_6:** Checks if the system is in state `q_6`.
        * **s.x <= 20:** Checks if the clock `x` (a local clock within the Uppaal model) is less than or equal to 20.

Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: If the system reaches q_13, will it eventually be in q_2?

```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_13, will it eventually be in q_2?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_13 --> s.q_2"}
```


```
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_13, will it eventually be in q_2?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_13 --> s.q_2"
Verification Result: True

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Model Answer:  



```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_10 forever exist?", "uppaal_query": "E[[]] s.q_10"}
```


**Explanation:**

* **{}**:  Represents a JSON object containing information about the task, the original request, and the resulting Uppaal query. 
* **"task": "verification"**: Indicates that we want to perform a verification task.
* **"query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_10 forever exist?"**: This is the user's natural language query.
* **"uppaal_query": "E[[]] s.q_10"**:  This is the translated Uppaal query:

    * **E[[]]**:  Means "Eternally Exists," indicating we're looking for a path where `s.q_10` remains true indefinitely.
    * **s.q_10:** Refers to the state `q_10`.

Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

**Explanation:**

* **task**: This field specifies the type of task, which is `verification` in this case.
* **query_nl**:  Reflects the original natural language query asked by the user.
* **uppaal_query**: Contains the translated Uppaal expression. This specific query utilizes the CTL operator `A<>`, meaning "Always Eventually," effectively checking if reaching state `s.q_1` is guaranteed along every possible execution path of the system.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Answer:
Model Answer:  




```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where state q_2 is reached exist?", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_2"}
```

**Explanation:**

The user asks about the existence of a path leading to state `q_2`.  In Uppaal, we express this using the temporal operator `E<>` which means "Exists Eventually", indicating that there is at least one possible sequence of events where state `q_2` is eventually reached. 


Therefore, the Uppaal query generated is: `E<> s.q_2`
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where state q_2 is reached exist?", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_2"

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

### How Uppaal syntax was constructed

1. **Task:** set to "verification" as we are verifying a property about the automaton.
2. **Query_{NL}:** keeps the original user query unchanged  
3. **Uppaal_query:** translates the natural language to Uppaal:
    * `E<>`: Stands for "Exists Eventually." This operator checks if there exists at least one possible path through the automaton where the given condition holds true.
    * `s.q_4`: refers to being in state "q_4" and s signifies the template instance.

Therefore, `E<> s.q_4` expresses the condition: "There exists a path where the automaton eventually reaches state q_4."

Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_0 for up to 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_0 && s.x <= 15"}

{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_0 for up to 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_0 && s.x <= 15"} 
```



Let me break down why this is the right Uppaal translation:

* **`A[]`**:  This means "always" - ensuring that the condition holds true for the entire duration analyzed by Uppaal.
* **`s.q_0`**: This refers to checking if the current location of our automated system is `q_0`. Remember, we use `s.` to denote template instances within Uppaal.
* **`s.x <= 15`**: This checks whether the value of the clock variable `x` (the internal timer of our automaton) is less than or equal to 15 time units.

**Combined Meaning:**

The Uppaal query essentially verifies if our system remains in state `q_0` while simultaneously keeping its clock variable (`x`) within a limit of 15 time units.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is there any path where the system stays in state q_3 forever?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_3"}
6. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it always true that if the system is in state q_14, it is not in state q_1, or if it is in state q_13, it is not in state q_1?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it always true that if the system is in state q_14, it is not in state q_1, or if it is in state q_13, it is not in state q_1?", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_14 imply not s.q_1 or s.q_13 imply not s.q_1"}
7. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}
8. Input (Natural Language Query): "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}
10. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is there a deadlock situation in the automaton of the factory?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is there a deadlock situation in the automaton of the factory?", "uppaal_query": "A[] not deadlock"}
}
Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Here is the user question: Does a path where the system stays in state q_0 forever exist?
Answer:
Model Answer:  	{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_0 forever exist?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_0"}



**Explanation:**


Let me break down the translation process:
1. **Task Identification:**  We identify the task is "verification," meaning we want to check the validity of a property against the automaton.

2. **Query in Natural Language:** This is directly lifted from the user's question: "Does a path where the system stays in state q_0 forever exist?".

3. **Uppaal Syntax Translation:**

* `E[]`: This operator translates the concept of "exists" combined with "always," meaning there exists at least one path where the specified condition holds indefinitely.  
* `s.q_0`: This represents the Uppaal expression for being in state `q_0`. Since it refers to the discovered system`template instance`s state,  we use `s.q_0`. Combined with `E[]`, it means "there exists a path where the automaton always remains in state `q_0`".




Let me know if you have any other queries you'd like translated!

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

#####################################################################################
Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Verification Result: False

#####################################################################################
Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_4 forever exist?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_4"} 
```



Let me break down why this Uppaal query translates the natural language concept:

* **E[]**: This operator stands for "Exists []". It means we are looking for at least one possible execution path (within the overall system behavior) where the following condition holds true along the entire path.

* **s.q_4**: This refers to state `q_4` within the Uppaal model.

**Therefore, E[] s.q_4 essentially asks:**  "does there exist a path through the automaton where the system *always* remains in state `q_4`?"

This directly aligns with the original user query.
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_4 forever exist?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_4"

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}
8. Input (Natural Language Query): "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}
10. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is there a deadlock situation in the automaton of the factory?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is there a deadlock situation in the automaton of the factory?", "uppaal_query": "A[] not deadlock"}

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

### Key Point to Remember: 

* **Template Instance:**  Every time variable is local to its  template instance. If asking about a clock, make sure to prefix it by the specific template instance name used in your Uppaal model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14']
Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_1 and q_13.
Answer:
Model Answer:  


```json
{"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_1 and q_13.", "uppaal_query": "E<> (s.q_1 || s.q_13)"}

```

**Explanation:**

* **`task`: `"verification"`**:
Indicate that the request involves verifying a property of the automaton.
* **`query_nl`: `"Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_1 and q_13."`**: Repeats the original user query for clarity.
* **`uppaal_query`: `"E<> (s.q_1 || s.q_13)"`**:  This translates the natural language query into Uppaal syntax. Here's how it breaks down:
    * `E<>`: This stands for "Exists Eventually," meaning there must be at least one path through the state transitions where the following condition holds true.
    * `(s.q_1 || s.q_13)`: This checks if the system reaches state  `s.q_1` OR state `s.q_13`.



Let me know if you have more queries you'd like me to translate!

Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_1 and q_13.", "uppaal_query": "E<> (s.q_1 && s.q_13)"
Verification Result: False

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
