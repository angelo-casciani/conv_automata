2. Input (Natural Language Query): Simulate the execution of the production process to produce 100 pieces.
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "sim_with_number_products", "simulation_time": "", "target_pieces": 100, "stations_sequence": [], "query_nl": "Simulate the execution of the production process."}
3. Input (Natural Language Query): What is the next production station after station 1 and station 2?
   Output (LLM answer): {"task": "event_prediction", "simulation_time": "", "target_pieces": "", "stations_sequence": ["Station1", "Station2"], "query_nl": "What is the next production station after station 1 and station 2?"
4. Input (Natural Language Query): What is the mean waiting time for producing 200 products?
   Output (LLM answer): {"task": "sim_with_number_products", "simulation_time": "", "target_pieces": 200, "stations_sequence": [], "query_nl": "What is the mean waiting time for producing 200 products?"
5. Input (Natural Language Query): What is the mean waiting time of station 3 for producing 200 products?
   Output (LLM answer): {"task": "sim_with_number_products", "simulation_time": "", "target_pieces": 200, "stations_sequence": [], "query_nl": "What is the mean waiting time of station 3 for producing 200 products?"}}
