Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

Model Answer:  {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_0.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s._init_ s.q_0"}

<<EXPLANATION>>
We want to find out whether the system will always eventually reach state q_0 from any initial state (_init_). To express this in Uppaal using CTL, we use the operator A<> which represents "always eventually" for reaching state q_0 from the initial state (s._init_). The correct answer is given above.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."

Model Answer:  Based on the given context and question, I would suggest the following LLM answer with Uppaal query:

```json
{
  "task": "verification",
  "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_13 and q_14.",
  "uppaal_query": "E<>(s.q_13 || s.q_14)"
}
```
This Uppaal query checks for the existence of at least one path through the automaton where either state `q_13` or state `q_14` is visited.
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches at least once the states q_13 and q_14.", "uppaal_query": "E<> (s.q_13 && s.q_14)"

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Model Answer:  {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where the system stays in state q_0 forever exist?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_0"}
<</ANSWER>>

This query checks if there exists a path in the system where the system remains in state q_0 forever. It uses the "E[]" temporal operator to denote existence along the entire path. However, since the current query asks if such a path exists and not if it is desirable, the result may indicate undesired behavior, depending on the context.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system).

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Here's a breakdown of the generated query:

* Task: verification
* Natural language query: If the system reaches q_7, will it eventually be in q_1?
* Uppaal query: We want to express that whenever the condition's.q_7' holds (i.e., the system is in state q_7), then the state q_1 should eventually hold ('s.q_1'). This results in the syntax's.q_7 --> s.q_1' in Uppaal notation.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).

Prompt: <s>[INST]
<<SYS>>
Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}
2. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is there a path where state q_1 is reached?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is there a path where state q_1 is reached?", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_1"}
3. Input (Natural Language Query): "Simulate the system for up to 30 time units and track the states of all locations and the entity's location and edge."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Simulate the system for up to 30 time units and track the states of all locations and the entity's location and edge.", "uppaal_query": "simulate[<=30]{s.q_1, s.q_6, s.q_11, s.q_10, s.q_0, s.q_13, s.__init__, s.q_3, s.q_4, s.q_12, s.q_14, s.q_9, s.q_5, s.q_7, s.q_8, s.q_2, s.loc_entity, s.edge_entity}"}
