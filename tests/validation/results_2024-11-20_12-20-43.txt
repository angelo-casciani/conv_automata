Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14', 'q_15', 'q_16', 'q_17']
Here is the user question: If the system reaches q_5, will it eventually be in q_13?
Answer: 
Model Answer: {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_5, will it eventually be in q_13?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_5 --> s.q_13"}
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_5, will it eventually be in q_13?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_5 --> s.q_13"

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.

Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14', 'q_15', 'q_16', 'q_17']
Here is the user question: Verify if the automaton reaches the states q_6 and q_11.
Answer: 
Model Answer: {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches the states q_6 and q_11.", "uppaal_query": "E<> (s.q_6 && s.q_11)"}
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton reaches the states q_6 and q_11.", "uppaal_query": "E<> (s.q_6 && s.q_11)"

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).

The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q (in Uppaal, written as p --> q): Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Prompt: Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

5. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is there any path where the system stays in state q_3 forever?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is there any path where the system stays in state q_3 forever?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_3"}
6. Input (Natural Language Query): "Simulate the system over time and check the location and edge entity variables."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Simulate the system over time and check the location and edge entity variables.", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_3"}
7. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}
8. Input (Natural Language Query): "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}
}
Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
Here is the context: The automaton states are: ['_init_', 'q_0', 'q_1', 'q_2', 'q_3', 'q_4', 'q_5', 'q_6', 'q_7', 'q_8', 'q_9', 'q_10', 'q_11', 'q_12', 'q_13', 'q_14', 'q_15', 'q_16', 'q_17']
Here is the user question: Does the system will always eventually reach state q_11.
Answer: 
Model Answer: {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_11.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_11"}
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_11.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_11"
Verification Result: True
