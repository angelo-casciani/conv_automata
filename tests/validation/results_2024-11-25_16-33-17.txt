Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is there any path where the system stays in state q_3 forever?", "uppaal_query": "E[] s.q_3"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

<<QUESTION>>
Does a path where state q_3 is reached exist?
<</QUESTION>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer: Based on your question, I understand you want to verify if there exists a path in the system where the state `q_3` is reached. Here's the corresponding Uppaal query:

```json
{
  "task": "verification",
  "query_nl": "Does a path where state q_3 is reached exist?",
  "uppaal_query": "E><> s.q_3"
}
```
This query, `"E><> s.q_3"` means "there exists a path where state `q_3` is reached."
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Does a path where state q_3 is reached exist?", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_3"
Verification Result: False

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Explanation: The question implies an existential statement about the system always staying in a specific state, which corresponds to the Uppaal query "E[] s.q_10". This means we want to verify if there exists an execution path where the system stays in state "q_10" for eternity.

Model Answer: Based on your requirement, here's how I would represent this verification task in Uppaal:

```json
{
  "task": "verification",
  "query_nl": "Does the system will always eventually reach state q_1.",
  "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"
}
```

In Uppaal syntax, this corresponds to checking whether the system will eventually reach `state q_1` from every possible initial state ("always"). The `<>` operator is used to indicate eventuality.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if state q_6 is reachable within 15 time units.", "uppaal_query": "E<> s.q_6 && s.x <= 15"}

   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually reach q_6?", "uppaal_query": "s.q_0 --> s.q_6"
9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_4 for up to 30 time units.

Model Answer: {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_4 for up to 30 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_4 && s.x <= 30"}

Explanation: This query checks if the automaton can remain in state `q_4` for up to 30 time units. It uses the CTL operator `A[]` which asserts a property over all paths. In this case, it verifies that `s.q_4`, meaning the automaton is in state `q_4`, and `s.x <= 30`, ensuring that the clock does not exceed 30 time units.
Expected Answer: "task": "verification", "query_nl": "Verify if the automaton can always stay in state q_4 for up to 30 time units.", "uppaal_query": "A[] s.q_4 && s.x <= 30"

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1."
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Check if the system will always eventually reach state q_1.", "uppaal_query": "A<> s.q_1"}

9. Input (Natural Language Query): "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?"
   Output (LLM answer with Uppaal Query): {"task": "verification", "query_nl": "Is it true that the automaton always reach both state q_1 and q_5?", "uppaal_query": "A<> (s.q_1 && s.q_5)"}

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

Act as an assistant that translates natural language queries into a JSON object containing the Uppaal syntax to be verified against a timed automaton. The automaton has several locations (states) such as q_1, q_6, and q_11, and uses variables like x (a clock), Tcdf (for time bounds), and loc_entity, edge_entity (for entities in the system). Remember that x is a local clock in the template instance s, so it must be referenced as s.x.

The properties in Uppaal are typically expressed using Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and involve temporal operators such as:
A<>: "Always eventually" (checks if something will always eventually happen).
E<>: "Exists eventually" (checks if there is at least one path where something eventually happens).
A[]: "Always" (checks if something always holds).
E[]: "Exists" (checks if there's a path where something holds forever).
simulate[...]: Simulates the system behavior over a time period.
p --> q: Whenever p holds, q will eventually hold (not allowed within the scope of a quantifier).
p imply q: if p holds, then q holds.
deadlock: check for the presence of a deadlock.
Given a query in natural language, you will translate it into an Uppaal query compatible with the model.

Use these examples to translate user queries and construct the Uppaal syntax based on the model provided in the context. Always ensure that the queries fit the automaton's structure, and when referring to local variables like clocks, prefix them with the template instance name (e.g., s.x for the clock x in the DiscoveredSystem template).
