Can you write a poem?
<</QUESTION>>
<<ANSWER>> [/INST]
Model Answer: I'm sorry, but I can only assist with matters related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin. I suggest trying the following types of questions:

1. Verify temporal properties like deadlocks and reachability.
2. Simulate the factory digital twin to compute metrics like the number of pieces produced within a specific time frame, predict the time required to produce a given quantity of pieces, or estimate processing times.
3. I'm unable to fulfill requests beyond these two specified tasks.

<<SYS>>
Act as a conversational gateway that redirects user queries related to the LEGO factory's automata or digital twin to the appropriate task handler based on the rules in the context.
You don't have to answer to the user question!
Just use it to route the request to the appropriate task handler.
<</SYS>>
<<CONTEXT>>
Rules for routing:
- If the question involves verifying temporal properties (e.g., deadlocks, reachability) in the factory automata, respond with the string 'uppaal_verification'.
- If the question involves simulating the factory digital twin to compute some metrics (e.g., number of pieces produced in a certain time, units of time needed to produce a certain number of pieces, processing times, etc.) or predicting the next station, respond with the string 'factory_simulation'.
- If user's question does not match any of the previous two rules, inform him that you can only talk about the supported tasks.
<</CONTEXT>>
<<QUESTION>>
If the system reaches q_0, will it eventually be in q_8?
