Use the following pieces of context to generate from the user question a JSON object containing one of the allowed 'task': 'sim_with_time' for the number of pieces produced in a certain time and related metrics (e.g. processing time), 'sim_with_number_products' to know how much units of time needed to produce a certain number of pieces and related metrics (e.g. processing time) and 'event_prediction' for predicting the next station.
If the user question does not match an allowed tasks kindly refuse to answer.
Examples:
1. Input (Natural Language Query): Carry out a simulation for 1000 units of time to check how many pieces are produced.
